content: Pacman game

features:
  -  objective: control Pacman to eat all the pellets on the game map while avoiding being caught by ghosts (not of tsushima)
  -  controls: arrow keys to move
  -  the game doesn't continue new rounds automatically for each run, but shows the final score and requires user to replay instead

will be developed for more utilities even after the OOP course.
